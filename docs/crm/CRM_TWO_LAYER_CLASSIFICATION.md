## 2026-10-02 — Replit feedback branch recovery and line-by-line audit checkpoint

Historical recovery record: the former isolated branch `crm-ui-feedback-polish-2026-10-02` was recovered after the Replit workspace exhausted its credits. The branch is based directly on production checkpoint `97b43a7d158eb8b3cd773ed3febb45c4f8a52540` and contains the recovered UI/inventory implementation plus regression coverage.

### Audited implementation extracted for verification

- Lead cards now expose persisted `crm_leads.classification` separately from operational `crm_leads.lead_type`; missing classification is rendered as `Not recorded` and is not inferred from age, message history, budget, or AI output.
- Lead cards expose a persisted overdue-follow-up count derived from incomplete follow-ups whose due time has passed. No financial-risk label is inferred from budget.
- Lead status tones are secondary, low-contrast semantic styling and remain text-labelled; color is not the only meaning.
- Lead-card classification spacing and mobile hierarchy were hardened with explicit identity-to-classification separation and narrow-screen overflow coverage.
- Inventory KPI cards remain clickable and use full-inventory summaries/facets rather than page counts.
- Inventory search, status/BHK/locality/photo filters, sorting, and 24-row pagination now compose through the protected inventory overview response. Filter/sort changes reset to page zero; the browser ignores stale inventory/audit responses.
- Inventory pagination has explicit query validation and deterministic filter/sort/page regression coverage.
- Global and lead Activity requests use cancellation guards so stale responses cannot overwrite current state.
- Contact Classification filter/source changes reset pagination without issuing a stale page response.
- Browser regression coverage now exercises inventory page 2, filter reset, classification visibility, overdue attention, mobile classification spacing, and horizontal-overflow safety.

### Audit exclusions / corrections

- Replit-only `.replit` and startup-instruction asset were removed from the promotion candidate.
- Replit-mutated dependency ranges and package-firewall lockfile URLs were removed; the production `package.json` and `package-lock.json` were restored to the verified `97b43a7` baseline.
- No production database write, webhook/integration change, schema migration, or Render deployment is included in this checkpoint.

### Verification state

Implementation review is complete at the repository diff level. Build, full automated tests, browser regression, production deployment, and branch reconciliation remain evidence-gated until the recovered candidate is executed and verified. This section must not be interpreted as a production-live claim.

# CRM Two-Layer Classification and Webhook Gate

## Historical recovered-candidate display contract

The former `crm-ui-feedback-polish-2026-10-02` candidate specified that a promoted CRM lead may display its persisted `crm_leads.classification` value, separately from the operational `crm_leads.lead_type` status. A missing classification is shown as “Not recorded”; the UI does not infer or rewrite a classification.

The Contact Classification queue remains the source of operator decisions. “Cold Inquiry” is shown only when present in stored classification data; lead age, message age, budget, and AI output do not create cold-lead or financial-risk labels. An overdue attention cue is derived only from an incomplete stored follow-up whose due time has passed. These are display-only changes and do not alter the promotion transaction or classification registry.

## Authoritative current verified state — 2026-10-04 01:19 IST

This is the latest repository/production checkpoint. Older dated sections in maintained documents are historical evidence and must not be interpreted as current state.

### Test-history checkpoint

The P1–P5 hardening release added regression coverage for webhook promotion linkage, reserved AU/AV exclusion, and disposable inventory create/edit/delete history. The final repository verification is 120/120 automated tests, browser 1/1, and production build PASS. Historical earlier test counts in dated handoff/audit sections are retained as historical checkpoints.



## Current production behavior — 2026-09-30

The Contact Classification screen is intentionally simple: one queue with two tabs.

- **Waiting for classification:** pending and non-qualified contacts.
- **Qualified lead pushed to CRM:** contacts successfully promoted into Lead CRM.

The operator selects one classification and clicks **Update**. A non-qualified choice saves as excluded and remains outside Lead CRM. A **Qualified Lead** choice executes the transactional promotion path and moves the contact only after the database confirms success. Each row includes a direct **Open WhatsApp** link.

The 2026-09-30 production failure was PostgreSQL `42P18` in the new-lead insert. The cause was an untyped `$5` parameter inside `jsonb_build_object()`; the consolidated fix explicitly casts `$5::text`. The operator retry succeeded after deployment.

## Canonical flow

1. WhAPI callback arrives for the connected source `+919148338801`.
2. The Supabase Edge Function authenticates the callback and persists the callback in `crm_webhook_events`.
3. The webhook event is not rejected because the contact is unknown or non-qualified.
4. Message events with a resolvable phone are reconciled into `crm_contact_classifications`.
5. Contact classification is Layer 1: Qualified Lead; Personal / Family; Agent / Partner; Business; Promotion / Marketing; Vendor / Supplier; Internal; Cold Inquiry; Property Listing Sent (legacy historical only); Unknown / Pending.
6. Only Qualified Lead is eligible to create/promote a `crm_leads` record.
7. `crm_leads.lead_type` is Layer 2 and describes the operational state of an already-qualified lead.
8. Qualified live messages are appended to `crm_messages` using provider message identity and original message timestamp.
9. Non-qualified contacts remain in the classification/event layers; their events are not promoted into CRM.
10. If a non-qualified contact is later classified as Qualified Lead, the promotion path creates the lead and backfills preserved message events.

## Credential boundary

The WhAPI channel API token is a provider credential. It is not a semantic classifier and is not required by the inbound webhook receiver. The inbound receiver uses a separate webhook authentication secret. Production secret material must not be committed to GitHub or placed in the Render browser/API environment unnecessarily.

## Historical data rule

The historical SQLite archive remains source evidence. It must not be reclassified from aggregate statistics. Current production Supabase records carry their own source and webhook provenance.

## No intake queue

`crm_intake_contacts` / `crm_intake_messages` are not part of this architecture. The classification registry replaces the intake queue.

## Inventory

Inventory sender/source routing is outside this CRM classification path and remains unchanged.

## AI scheduler — intentionally paused

- `crm_ai_scheduler_6h` is **paused** as of 2026-10-04.
- Its implementation and `crm_invoke_ai_scheduler()` function remain in the repository and database.
- The pg_cron trigger has been removed, so no recurring AI scheduler execution is currently scheduled.
- The deterministic classification scheduler remains active independently at `0 * * * *`.
- Reactivation requires an explicit operational decision and a new scheduler activation.

## Deterministic classification engine — current verified

- Deterministic classification is active for source +919148338801; it does not call AI.
- New WhatsApp messages remain attached to the same crm_contact_classifications record while a contact is pending; conversation history accumulates in crm_messages and webhook evidence remains in crm_webhook_events.
- The scheduler runs hourly at 0 * * * * through Supabase Cron job crm_deterministic_scheduler_1h.
- Qualification requires customer-originated intent plus property/requirement evidence. Outbound property messages alone cannot qualify a contact.
- Known operator-confirmed Internal, Personal/Family, Agent/Partner, Vendor/Supplier and Group Message exclusions remain protected.
- New automatic decisions are Qualified Lead or an approved Unqualified classification. Property Listing Sent is legacy/historical only and is never generated by the deterministic engine.
- Insufficient evidence remains Waiting for Classification and is reevaluated when new conversation evidence arrives.
- Deterministically qualified leads persist auto_qualified=true and display AUTO QUALIFIED on the lead card.
- Every deterministic evaluation records rule version, evidence message/event IDs, reason and audit provenance.
