# CRM UI branch reconciliation

## Unreleased feedback branch — not reconciled or deployed

Work is isolated on `crm-ui-feedback-polish-2026-10-02`. The production reconciliation details below remain unchanged and do not include this branch. This work adds only CRM UI/read-only overview behavior and regression coverage; no merge, deployment, production-data write, integration change, or schema migration has been performed. Record the branch’s local verification separately from the production verification below.

## Authoritative current verified state — 2026-10-01 21:55 IST

### Current operational flow

  -> crm_webhook_events (persist + deduplicate)
  -> webhook processor/reconciler
  -> crm_messages + classification registry
  -> operator classification update

       -> Qualified Lead: audited promotion transaction

  -> persisted crm_ai_runs + crm_drafts + provenance
  -> operator review/edit/pre-send grounding
  -> manual WhatsApp action only; no automatic send

```

### Test-history checkpoint

The P1–P5 hardening release added regression coverage for webhook promotion linkage, reserved AU/AV exclusion, and disposable inventory create/edit/delete history. The final repository verification was 71/71 automated tests, browser 1/1, and production build PASS. Historical earlier test counts in dated handoff/audit sections are retained as historical checkpoints.

## Current contract

- GitHub contains only the intended `crm-ui-dashboard` and `main` branches for the UI workstream.
- The UI source selector exposes all three audited EFPS WhatsApp source numbers: `+919148338801`, `+917975102130`, `+919902024973`. The connected live WhAPI ingress remains `+919148338801`.
- Current production evidence is 186 leads, 310 classifications, 23 pending classifications, 186 promoted classifications, and 6,870 CRM messages for +919148338801.
- Historical message provenance remains source-backed; SQLite message IDs are stored as `source_message_id`, not fabricated provider IDs.
- The live CRM path is lead-only. There is no listener abstraction, no inventory listener, no lead listener or staged intake queue. `crm_contact_classifications` is the pre-lead registry and operator qualification gate.
- WhAPI pushes `messages` webhooks to the Supabase Edge Function `whapi-crm-webhook`.
- `crm_webhook_events` records the webhook activity before lead/message processing.
- Existing promoted source-phone leads receive appended messages; unseen source-phone contacts remain classifications/messages until an operator selects Qualified Lead.
- `crm_messages` is rendered chronologically by provider `message_at`.
- Supabase Realtime signals the UI after message insertion; the browser does not poll WhAPI or poll the CRM workspace.
- The CRM never sends WhatsApp messages automatically.
- Render remains the authenticated UI/API host. Supabase is the live webhook ingress and CRM database. No AWS runtime is used for the CRM webhook.

## Data gates completed

The current production CRM registry contains 186 leads and 310 classifications, with 23 pending classifications and 186 promoted. Current CRM messages total 6,870 for the production source. No separate intake queue is used.

## Live webhook gate

Current persisted counts are 186 leads, 310 classifications, 6,870 messages and 465 webhook events (465 processed, 0 received, 0 processing, 0 failed).

The WhAPI-to-Supabase live ingress is enabled for the current production source. Do not run another historical WhAPI API extraction as part of ordinary CRM reconciliation. Historical SQLite evidence and live webhook data remain distinct provenance classes.

## Classification write fix — 2026-09-30

A single operator test on contact `+919216063368` produced the definitive Render diagnostic: PostgreSQL `42P18`, `could not determine data type of parameter $5`, at the `insert lead` stage. The failing parameter was the source number passed into `jsonb_build_object()` during new-lead creation. The consolidated fix explicitly casts that parameter to `text`. Local build and the full 62-test suite passed before deployment. Render deployment `dep-daum4rtg1s2s73cntsv0` is live from commit `45dbab7b1ba92387e5e001f74929ad40c92be6a9`. The subsequent operator retry succeeded.
