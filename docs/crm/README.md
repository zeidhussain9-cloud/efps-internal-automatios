# EasyFind CRM Documentation

## Current verified repository state — 2026-10-01

This section is the current checkpoint for maintained documentation. Dated audit sections below remain historical evidence and are not silently rewritten.

- **Canonical UI/deployment branch:** `crm-ui-dashboard`
- **`crm-ui-dashboard` commit:** `da13083f6cb1f3c78ec3f4df661c515d43f556fa`
- **`crm-ui-dashboard` tree:** `f36a5ccb4bae742e83603b09bee59d01595ecf00`
- **`main` reconciliation commit:** `692bdcbbab51752b8eb7d4927921d1cfc4830de7`
- **`main` tree:** `f36a5ccb4bae742e83603b09bee59d01595ecf00`
- **Tree equality:** `tree(main) == tree(crm-ui-dashboard)` = **TRUE**; commit histories differ by design.
- **Render:** `easyfind-crm-d01-d05` / `srv-darsv560tbcc73cu4ip0`, deployment `dep-dav55km0tbcc73eelat0`, **live**.
- **Production source:** `+919148338801`.
- **Supabase CRM:** 186 leads; 307 classifications; 20 pending; 186 promoted; 6,853 messages; 436 webhook events, 436 processed, 0 received, 0 processing, 0 failed.
- **AI persistence:** 196 AI runs, 196 proposed; 196 drafts; 186 AI cursors.
- **Inventory:** 88 active Housing rows; 1,333 sync-run records; latest recorded sync = 88 rows / 0 changed / 0 removed; AU/AV remain outside the CRM operational A:AT mirror.
- **Schedulers:** `crm_webhook_reconcile_1m` active every minute; `crm_inventory_sheet_reconcile_5m` active every five minutes.
- **P1–P5:** implemented and production-verified as documented in `docs/audits/PRODUCTION_LIVE_WEBHOOK_AND_INVENTORY_AUDIT_2026-10-01.md`.
- **Verification:** `npm run build` PASS; `npm test` PASS (71/71); `npm run test:browser` PASS (1/1).
- **GitHub:** active remote UI branch search returns only `crm-ui-dashboard`; historical UI/inventory branches with deleted remotes are retained only as local historical evidence and are not active deployment branches.

### Current operational flow

```text
WhAPI +919148338801
  -> crm_webhook_events (persist + deduplicate)
  -> webhook processor/reconciler
  -> crm_messages + classification registry
  -> operator classification update
       -> non-qualified: remains outside CRM leads
       -> Qualified Lead: audited promotion transaction
            -> crm_leads + preserved messages
            -> webhook event lead linkage reconciled

CRM lead workspace
  -> complete chronological conversation + normalized requirements + evidence + notes + prior AI runs + cursor
  -> Bedrock primary / Sonnet fallback / Ollama fallback
  -> persisted crm_ai_runs + crm_drafts + provenance
  -> operator review/edit/pre-send grounding
  -> manual WhatsApp action only; no automatic send

Housing_Listings A:AV
  -> CRM reads operational A:AT only
  -> 88-row operational mirror in crm_inventory_snapshot
  -> five-minute reconciliation
  -> crm_inventory_sync_changes records future field-level changes
```

### Test-history checkpoint

The P1–P5 hardening release added regression coverage for webhook promotion linkage, reserved AU/AV exclusion, and disposable inventory create/edit/delete history. The final repository verification was 71/71 automated tests, browser 1/1, and production build PASS. Historical earlier test counts in dated handoff/audit sections are retained as historical checkpoints.



## Canonical working branch

`crm-ui-dashboard`

## Source hierarchy

**Leads:** the local extraction source defined by `docs/audits/LEADS_EXTRACTION_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_AUDIT.md`. The local SQLite dataset produced by that extraction is the only lead dataset used by this CRM.

**Inventory:** verified Housing Listings contract/audit for property facts and D05.

## Documents

- `CRM_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_RECONCILIATION.md` — current reconciled source and architecture boundary
- `CRM_DATA_MODEL.md` — canonical CRM/UI fields
- `CRM_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` — D00–D08 decision register
- `CRM_UI_DESIGN_SPEC.md` — UI behavior
- `LEAD_CRM_MASTER_PLAN.md` — delivery sequence and gates

The two audit reports under `docs/audits/` are dated evidence snapshots. The leads audit is the authoritative source document for the local lead dataset.

## Approved design state

D01–D05 are approved, D06 is resolved, D07 is resolved, and D08 remains unresolved.

## Historical prototype boundary

The original prototype was synthetic-only. That dated boundary is retained for historical context; the current CRM production path uses source-scoped Supabase data for `+919148338801`. Automatic WhatsApp sending remains disabled, and inventory remains read-only from the CRM.

## CRM AI-specific steering

`steering.md` at repository root is the **dedicated, executable system prompt** for the hosted CRM Ollama adapter. It is deliberately distinct from the repository agent protocol `CORE_STEERING.md` and from canonical business facts in `docs/BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md`. Its limited EFPS context is loaded server-side and cached once per process; the fictional pilot remains the only authorized model input. See `CRM_AI_AND_LEAD_IMPORT_GATE_2026-09-27.md` for the verified hosted response and remaining data-import gates.


## 2026-10-01 — Current production closure status

The CRM browser regression is fixed and D07 is resolved on `crm-ui-dashboard`. D07 covers operator session security, sensitive-data masking, reversible archive, audit visibility, explicit export controls, retention/deletion boundaries and offline handling. D08 remains open.

## 2026-10-01 production AI checkpoint

The CRM AI workspace is now production-enabled on Render service `srv-darsv560tbcc73cu4ip0`. It analyzes the complete stored conversation and lead context rather than fictional fixtures. Requirements are normalized and editable in the Lead Workspace. AI proposals include evidence-backed requirement changes, timeline/context analysis, a suggested lead status, and a versioned reply draft. The AI does not automatically send WhatsApp messages.
